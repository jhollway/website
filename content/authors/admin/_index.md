I'm an associate professor of international relations and political science at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva. 
I develop relational theories, methods, and data for tackling questions about the complex institutional structures governing domains such as fisheries, freshwater, and trade.
I bring aspects of this agenda to my teaching, which ranges from courses in statistics and workshops on statistical network modelling,
through to more theoretical and substantive courses such as an interdisciplinary course on environmental institutions or on the concept of time in political relations.
At the Graduate Institute, I also serve as co-director of the Professional Skills Training programme,
and am affiliated with the Center for International Environmental Studies, the Center for Trade and Economic Integration, and the Global Governance Centre.

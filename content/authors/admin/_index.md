How do actors seek to address environmental and economic interdependencies through institutions?
How do the complex networks of institutions they have set up affect how they relate to one another?
Are these institutions effective? And how can we design or reform them to improve outcomes? 

In my research, I develop multilevel and dynamic theories, methods, and data 
to help us better understand the implications of institutional and policy choices in these contexts.

<!-- I am Principle Investigator of the PANARCHIC project

 a new 4-year  -->

<!-- At the Graduate Institute, I serve as co-director of the *Professional Skills Training* programme,
and am affiliated with the *Center for International Environmental Studies*, the *Center for Trade and Economic Integration*, and the *Global Governance Centre*. -->
